# Password Strength Analyzer

This repository contains a simple command-line tool developed in Python to check the strength of a password based on a set of common security rules. The project was created as a practical exercise to demonstrate understanding of cyber hygiene and password policies.

## Key Concepts

The `password_checker.py` script helps to illustrate the following concepts:

* **Cyber Hygiene:** The practice of maintaining the security of an online account.
* **Password Policy:** A set of rules that governs the characteristics of passwords to enhance security.
* **Password Vulnerabilities:** Common weaknesses in passwords that make them susceptible to attacks.

## How to Run the Tool

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher installed.
* A code editor like VS Code or an environment like Jupyter Notebook.

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/AKASH-00018/cyber-security-internship-task10](https://github.com/AKASH-00018/cyber-security-internship-task10)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```
    cd cyber-security-internship-task10
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    * **From VS Code Terminal:** Open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl + `) and run the following command:
        ```
        python password_checker.py
        ```
    * **From Command Prompt/PowerShell:** Navigate to the directory and run:
        ```
        python password_checker.py
        ```

The tool will prompt you to enter a password and will then provide an analysis of its strength.
